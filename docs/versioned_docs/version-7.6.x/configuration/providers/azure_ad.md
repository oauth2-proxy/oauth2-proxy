For adding an application to the Microsoft Azure AD follow [these steps to add an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

Take note of your `TenantId` if applicable for your situation. The `TenantId` can be used to override the default 
`common` authorization server with a tenant specific server.
