OAuth2 Proxy responds directly to the following endpoints. All other endpoints will be proxied upstream when authenticated. The `/oauth2` prefix can be changed with the `--proxy-prefix` config variable.

- /robots.txt - returns a 200 OK response that disallows all User-agents from all paths; see [robotstxt.org](http://www.robotstxt.org/) for more info
- /ping - returns a 200 OK response, which is intended for use with health checks
- /metrics - Metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape, serve on the address specified by `--metrics-address`, disabled by default
- /oauth2/sign_in - the login page, which also doubles as a sign out page (it clears cookies)
- /oauth2/sign_out - this URL is used to clear the session cookie
- /oauth2/start - a URL that will redirect to start the OAuth cycle
- /oauth2/callback - the URL used at the end of the OAuth cycle. The oauth app will be configured with this as the callback url.
- /oauth2/userinfo - the URL is used to return user's email from the session in JSON format.
- /oauth2/auth - only returns a 202 Accepted response or a 401 Unauthorized response; for use with the [Nginx `auth_request` directive](../configuration/overview.md#configuring-for-use-with-the-nginx-auth_request-directive)

### Sign out

To sign the user out, redirect them to `/oauth2/sign_out`. This endpoint only removes oauth2-proxy's own cookies, i.e. the user is still logged in with the authentication provider and may automatically re-login when accessing the application again. You will also need to redirect the user to the authentication provider's sign out page afterwards using the `rd` query parameter, i.e. redirect the user to something like (notice the url-encoding!):

```
/oauth2/sign_out?rd=https%3A%2F%2Fmy-oidc-provider.example.com%2Fsign_out_page
```

Alternatively, include the redirect URL in the `X-Auth-Request-Redirect` header:

```
GET /oauth2/sign_out HTTP/1.1
X-Auth-Request-Redirect: https://my-oidc-provider/sign_out_page
...
```

(The "sign_out_page" should be the [`end_session_endpoint`](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html#rfc.section.2.1) from [the metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) if your OIDC provider supports Session Management and Discovery.)

BEWARE that the domain you want to redirect to (`my-oidc-provider.example.com` in the example) must be added to the [`--whitelist-domain`](../configuration/overview) configuration option otherwise the redirect will be ignored.

### Auth

This endpoint returns 202 Accepted response or a 401 Unauthorized response.

It can be configured using the following query parameters:
- `allowed_groups`: comma separated list of allowed groups
- `allowed_email_domains`: comma separated list of allowed email domains
- `allowed_emails`: comma separated list of allowed emails
